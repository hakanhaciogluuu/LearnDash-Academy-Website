Sample design I made using HTML and Css.

Using HTML and CSS, develop a prototype according to the assigned work.

When creating your prototype, take the following elements as a reference:

• It must represent all the sections and elements that are in the assigned theme.

• It is not necessary to recreate animation elements.

• The hyperlinks should go to the page itself.

• Framework cannot be used.

• Consider good practices in using HTML 5 and CSS3.

• When delivering the work, you must include all the files necessary for the correct visualization 

of the work developed.
